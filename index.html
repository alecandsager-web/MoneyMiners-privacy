    <h1>MoneyMiners Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <p>MoneyMiners ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile mining game. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information when you use MoneyMiners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in using email, Google, or Apple Sign-In, we receive your authentication credentials (email address and a unique user ID). We do not store your password directly — authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Nickname:</strong> The in-game display name you choose.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your points, depth, pickaxe level, hired miners, achievements, streak data, and other gameplay statistics. This data is stored in Google Firebase Firestore to enable cloud saves.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device information such as device model and operating system version for app compatibility and crash reporting purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> Our advertising partner, AppLovin, may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve relevant ads. Please refer to <a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AppLovin's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain your game account and progress</li>
        <li>Sync your game data across devices via cloud saves</li>
        <li>Display your chosen nickname within the game</li>
        <li>Send push notifications (daily cap resets, streak reminders) if you opt in</li>
        <li>Display advertisements to support the free-to-play experience</li>
        <li>Improve app performance and fix bugs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore), which employ industry-standard encryption and security practices. Local preferences (such as tutorial completion status) are stored on your device using standard iOS storage and are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>MoneyMiners uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>AppLovin MAX:</strong> Ad serving and mediation. <a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AppLovin Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Apple Sign-In / Google Sign-In:</strong> Optional authentication methods governed by their respective privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>MoneyMiners may request permission to send push notifications for daily cap resets, streak reminders, and re-engagement messages. You can disable notifications at any time through your device's Settings app.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MoneyMiners is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete that information promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> the personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and associated data by contacting us</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out</strong> of push notifications via your device settings</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out</strong> of personalized advertising via your device's privacy settings (Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your game data for as long as your account is active. If you request account deletion, we will remove your data from our servers within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
